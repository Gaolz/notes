### Bootstrap 3 - Event hidden.bs.collapse not fired if the accordion is inside a modal populated via ajax


- 原因：
 1. You are trying to attach your event listener to elements with the .panel class before any elements with the .panel class exist in the DOM

***

- 解决：
  To make your code work, you can move your $('.panel').on(...) inside the AJAX success callback, after the .panels have actually been inserted to the DOM. Alternatively, and probably preferably, you may use event delegation instead
 ```js
 $('#modalbody').on('hidden.bs.collapse', '.panel', function (e) {
   alert('Event fired on #' + e.currentTarget.id);
 });
 ```
